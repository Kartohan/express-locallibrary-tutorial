# express-locallibrary-tutorial

I took the Express course at MDN. It was quite interesting and helped me a lot in understanding the backend

What i learned:

1. Pug view engine. I read and watched some tutorials before i started to using it, because at first glance it looks quite confusing. But now i can understand the code clearly.
2. Express, express routes. I had seen Express before that, so it didn't seem strange to me, but I had to rethink some things.
3. Async module. parallel, waterfall and series. There is callbacks inside callbacks and it feels strange but with some help on discord i got it.
4. Mongoose & MongoDB. I had some misunderstanding with schemas and models, but thanks to this small course, I understood that models are needed to manage database collections, and schemas define the data types inside the collections. And of course i learn some MongoDB queries.
5. Express validator. At first, I did not understand how to validate forms in the backend, but then I understood, with this module.
6. Heroku dotenv configuration, thanks to last MDN Express lesson.

What i used:

1. Express, expres routes, express-validator.
2. MongoDB, Mongoose.
3. Pug view engine.
4. Async module.
5. Moment for date format. I know what the lesson offered "luxon" module, but sometimes I turned on the Russian version of the lesson and this module was there at that time. I know it is no longer updated but it still performs its functions. Next time I will use luxon module.
6. dotenv for environment variables, nodemon for auto update, morgan for logging.
7. NPM for installing packages.
8. Heroku for deploying.
9. Git for version contol.

Also, if you look at the code, you will see there "var" as a variable declaration, this was also due to the fact that I sometimes turned on the Russian version of the lesson and it still uses this variable declaration.
